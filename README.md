# Code Challenge (LATEST UPDATE: 22/08/2022)

An automated traffic counter sits by a road and counts the number of cars that go
past. Every half-hour the counter outputs the number of cars seen and resets the counter
to zero. This program are coded to do the following tasks:
 - Task 1: Number of cars seen in total
 - Task 2: A sequence of lines (date format) and the number of cars seen on the day for all days
 - Task 3: The top 3 half hours with most cars
 - Task 4: The 1.5 hour period with least cars

### Pre-requisite:
Please make sure java compiler such as javac was installed. The program was tested in Java 8.

### Step to run the program on terminal:
1. javac CodeChallenge.java
2. java CodeChallenge <INPUTNAME> (e.g. java CodeChallenge "TinyInput.txt")
3. The result will be displayed in terminal
